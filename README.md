## About ShareCycle
ShareCycle is an application that allows you to lend and borrow items with your friends. Connect with your community while helping to reduce waste and create a more sustainable future.

_The application is currently in development. Please check back later for more updates._

## Configuration
- Create an env file with your PostgreSQL database and session.
  - Example: `DATABASE_URL="INSERT_LINK"` and `SESSION_SECRET="INSERT_SESSION_KEY"`
- Run `npx prisma db seed` to test some initial data on the database with the seed file. 
- Note: `prisma generate` command will generate your Prisma schema. Must run this command when there are changes to your schema.
